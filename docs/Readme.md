## Drogon

Drogon is a robust, lightweight application development framework used for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts on the ICON blockchain. The core features of the Drogon makes ICON smart contract developersâ€™ life easy by providing support for multiple contract compilations, tests, and deploying on a public and private network.

## Features

Drogon offers:

- End-to-end build cycle support for development, testing, and deploying smart contracts
- Support for Unit testing smart contracts
- Deployment management for deploying to public and private networks
- Interactive console to directly communicate with public and private networks
- Clear documentation for developers

Why Drogon?
