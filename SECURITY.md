# Reporting Drogon Security Issues

DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE to report a security problem. Instead, please send an email to `drogon@wefuzz.io` and provide your github username so we can add you to a new draft security advisory for further discussion.

For security reasons, DO NOT include attachments or provide detail sufficient for exploitation regarding the security issue in this email. Instead, wait for the advisory to be created, and provide any sensitive details in the private GitHub advisory.
